# Qr Code Generator with React

A simple qr code generator made using [react-qr-code](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-qr-code)

## How to use

1. Type the data you want to store in the QR code (the app will notify you when you ve reached the limit)
2. Type the background color you desire
3. Type the foreground (line color) you desire

**Note:** This is one of my firsts react projects so please excuse me if there is some "irrelevant" code in comments
